## Getting started with Workflow Templates

You can define reusable templates for Workflows. All Workflow Templates are defined as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG), here's an example of how a DAG template is defined:

```yaml
# The template to use as entrypoint
entrypoint: main
templates:
- name: main            
  dag:                      # Indicates that this is a DAG template
    tasks:
    - name: A               # First task to execute
      template: echo        # The template to use for first task in DAG
      arguments:            # Arguments to pass into the "echo" template
        parameters:
        - name: message
          value: A
    - name: B
      dependencies: [A]
      template: echo
      arguments:
        parameters:
        - name: message
          value: B
    - name: C
      dependencies: [A]
      template: echo
      arguments:
        parameters:
        - name: message
          value: C
    - name: D
      dependencies: [B, C]
      template: echo
      arguments:
        parameters:
        - name: message
          value: D
- name: echo                # Definition of "echo" template used by the nodes in DAG
  inputs:                   # Name of inputs 
    parameters:
    - name: message
  container:
    image: alpine:3.7
    command: [echo, "{{inputs.parameters.message}}"]
```

## Parameters

You can define and use parameters in your Workflow Templates. These parameters are displayed in the Workflow creation form (or are made available via CLI) and can be referenced in the template like so:

```yaml
'{{workflow.parameters.<parameter-name>}}'
```

The syntax for parameter definitions are as follows:

```yaml
arguments:
  parameters:
  - name: storage-class # Name, only alphanumeric characters and `-` allowed (required)
    value: ssd  # Default value (required)
    displayName: Storage class
    type: select.select # How to render this parameter in Workflow creation form in Web UI
    options:  # type of select.select and input.radio allow you to set options
    - name: SSD
      value: ssd
```

If a parameter is defined, `name` and `value` are required.

- `name` is the name of the parameters, only alphanumeric characters and `-` allowed
- `value` is the default value for the parameter
- `displayName` is the text that is displayed to the user
- `type` indicates how the parameter is rendered in the Workflow creation form in the Web UI. Possible values are:
    - `input.text` renders a textbox
    - `input.number` renders a textbox that only accepts numbers
    - `input.radio` renders radio buttons
    - `select.select` renders a dropdown
    - `textarea.textarea` renders a textarea
- `options` define options if `type` is `select.select` or `input.radio`
- `visibility` defines whether the parameter should be visible in Workflow execution form. Possible values are:
    - `public` parameters are visible to every where.
    - `protected` parameters are visible in Onepanel UI and components like CVAT.
    - `internal` parameters are visible in Onepanel UI only.
    - `private` parameters are not visible any where. For system use only.

Example:

```yaml {3-11,22}
arguments:
  parameters:
  - name: message-text
    value: my-message-2 # default value
    displayName: Message text
    type: select.select
    options:
    - name: my-message-1
      value: my-message-1
    - name: my-message-2
      value: my-message-2
entrypoint: main
templates:
- name: main
  dag:
    tasks:
    - name: A
      template: echo
      arguments:
        parameters:
        - name: message
          value: '{{workflow.parameters.message-text}}'
```

## Artifacts

When running Workflows, it is very common to have steps that generate or consume artifacts. Often, the output artifacts of one task may be used as input artifacts to a subsequent task.

Example below shows how you can download or upload artifacts from or to different object storage locations:

```yaml
entrypoint: main
arguments:
  # Workflow parameters which will be set by user via Web UI, SDK or API
  parameters:
  - name: model-path
    value: my-data/output
templates:
- name: main
  dag:
    tasks:
    - name: input-output
      template: input-output
- name: input-output
  container:
    args:
    - |
      printenv \
      && ls /tmp/input \
        && mkdir -p /tmp/output \
        && echo "hello" > /tmp/output/message.txt \
        && sleep 15
    command:
    - bash
    - -c
    image: bash
  inputs:
    artifacts:
    # Download files from S3 prefix random/input into local folder /tmp/input/
    # # This downloads from the default S3 artifact repository for this namespace
    - name: input
      path: /tmp/input/
      s3:
        key: my-data/input
  outputs:
    artifacts:
    # Upload files from local /tmp/output folder to default object storage location that is configured for this namespace
    # This is set to artifacts/{{workflow.namespace}}/{{workflow.name}}/{{pod.name}} by default
    - name: output-one
      path: /tmp/output
    # Upload files from local /tmp/output folder to S3 prefix my-data/output
    # This uploads to the default S3 artifact repository for this namespace
    - name: output-two
      path: /tmp/output
      s3:
        # Reference to the Workflow parameter that was set by user
        key: '{{workflow.parameters.model-path}}'
    # Upload files from local /tmp/output folder to the S3 prefix my-data/output in bucket defined below
    - name: output-three
      path: /tmp/output
      s3:
        key: '{{workflow.parameters.model-path}}'
        endpoint: storage.googleapis.com
        bucket: my-bucket-name
        accessKeySecret:
          name: my-s3-credentials
          key: accessKey
        secretKeySecret:
          name: my-s3-credentials
          key: secretKey

```

Using GCS
```yaml
...
    - name: output-three
      path: /tmp/output
      gcs:
        bucket: bucketofplenty
        key: /your/path
        serviceAccountKeySecret:
          name: onepanel
          key: serviceAccountKey
```

### Git integration with Workflows

You can also attach git repository (i.e Github) as an input artifact as follows.

```yaml
inputs:
    artifacts:
    - git:
        repo: https://github.com/onepanelio/Mask_RCNN.git
        revision: "no-boto"
      name: src
      path: /mnt/src
```
Here, we specified Github repository along with branch (`no-boto`). `path` specifies where to mount this repository.

You can also use private repository with Workflows. For that, you first need to [create personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) from Github. Then, go to `Settings` and add following two environment variables. `GITHUB_USERNAME` and `GITHUB_PASSWORD`. For `GITHUB_PASSWORD`, you should be using your personal access token. Once this is done, you can modify above yaml section as follows to use private repository.

```yaml
inputs:
    artifacts:
    - git:
        repo: https://github.com/onepanelio/Mask_RCNN.git
        revision: "no-boto"
        usernameSecret:
            name: onepanel-default-env
            key: GITHUB_USERNAME
        passwordSecret:
            name: onepanel-default-env
            key: GITHUB_PASSWORD
      name: src
      path: /mnt/src
```

### Archive

Artifacts can be packaged as Tarballs and gzipped by specifying an archive strategy, using the `archive` field:

```yaml
...
  outputs:
    artifacts:
    # Upload files from local /tmp/output folder to default object storage location that is configured for this namespace
    # This is set to artifacts/{{workflow.namespace}}/{{workflow.name}}/{{pod.name}} by default
    - name: output-one
      path: /tmp/output
      # Tar and gzip contents of /tmp/output folder and upload to the namespace configured artifact repository
      archive:
        tar: {}
...
```

### Optional

You can also mark both input and output artifacts as optional by setting `optional` to `true`. In this case, if they don't exist, the Workflow will not throw an error:

```yaml
...
  inputs:
    artifacts:
    # Download files from S3 prefix random/input into local folder /tmp/input/
    # # This downloads from the default S3 artifact repository for this namespace
    - name: input
      path: /tmp/input/
      optional: true # Don't throw an error if the file doesn't exist in the S3 location
      s3:
        key: my-data/input
...
```

### Troubleshooting

Following is a list of common problems that you may encounter while working with workflows and solutions for them.

1. Failed with exit code 'x' (i.e 1)
This usually happens when there is an error in the script/code you are trying to run. Usually, taking a look at logs and solving the errors reported will work.

2. Failed to load artifacts: timed out waiting for the condition
This happens when artifacts could not be mounted to the machine. A common case when this happens is when you are tring to attach data larger than your disk size. Try increasing your disk space. 

3. Failed to load artifacts: The specified key does not exist
You will encounter this error when you are trying to attach data which does not exists. Look at the name and path of file(s).

4. The node was low on resource: memory. Container wait was using 20172Ki, which exceeds its request of 0. Container main was using 11074832Ki, which exceeds its request of 0
This happens when you are trying to run code which is compute intensive and you don't have enough compute attached to your cluster.
