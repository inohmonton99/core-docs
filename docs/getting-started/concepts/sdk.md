Onepanel's [Python SDK](https://github.com/onepanelio/python-sdk) can be used to programmatically perform any task that is available through the web UI.

Additionally, you can use the Python SDK to [define Workflows](https://github.com/onepanelio/python-sdk/blob/master/examples/python-defined-workflow.ipynb)

Some examples include:

- [Define Workflows in Python](https://github.com/onepanelio/python-sdk/blob/master/examples/python-defined-workflow.ipynb)
- [Execute Workflows from Workspaces](https://github.com/onepanelio/python-sdk/blob/master/examples/execute-workflow.ipynb)
- [Automatically launch CVAT annotation Workspaces](https://github.com/onepanelio/templates/tree/release-v0.18.0/workflows/auto-cvat)
