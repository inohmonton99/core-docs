Onepanel's Python SDK can be used to programmatically perform any task that is available through the web UI. It is by default installed in all out of the box Workspaces and Workflows in Onepanel.

Additionally, you can use the Python SDK to define Workflows in Python and execute them from any environment that supports Python.

See [Python SDK](/docs/reference/sdks/python) in **User Guide** for more detailed information.
