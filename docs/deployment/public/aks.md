This document outlines the installation steps for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

:::tip
This document outlines a production deployment of Onepanel. If you want to quickly try Onepanel, start with our [Quick start](/docs/getting-started/quickstart).
:::

## Launch an AKS cluster
:::note
Make sure [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) (`az`) is installed before proceeding.
:::

We recommend launching a cluster with 2 `Standard_D4s_v3` nodes to start, with autoscaling and network policy enabled. You can add additional CPU/GPU node pools as needed later.

Here is a sample `az` command to create a bare minimum cluster:

```bash
az aks create --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --location <region> \
    --node-count 2 \
    --node-vm-size Standard_D4s_v3 \
    --node-osdisk-size 100 \
    --min-count 2 \
    --max-count 5 \
    --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
    --network-plugin azure \
    --network-policy azure \
    --enable-addons monitoring \
    --generate-ssh-keys
```

You can then get access credentials by running:

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --admin
```

Optionally, you can add additional auto-scaling node pools to the cluster as follows:

```bash
az aks nodepool add --resource-group <resource-group> --cluster-name <cluster-name> \
  --name <nodepool-name> \
  --node-vm-size <node-vm-size> \
  --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
  --node-count 1 \
  --min-count 0 \
  --max-count <max-count>
```

In step <strong>1.3</strong> below, you can configure Onepanel to automatically scale these nodes as needed.

## Install Onepanel
1. Download the latest `opctl` for your operating system from [our release page](https://github.com/onepanelio/core/releases/latest).

  <Tabs
    defaultValue="linux"
    values={[
      { label: 'Linux', value: 'linux', },
      { label: 'macOS', value: 'macos', },
      { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
    ]
  }>
  <TabItem value="linux">

  ```bash
  # Download the binary
  curl -sLO https://github.com/onepanelio/core/releases/download/latest/opctl-linux-amd64

  # Make binary executable
  chmod +x opctl-linux-amd64

  # Move binary to path
  mv ./opctl-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/opctl

  # Test installation
  opctl version
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

  ```bash
  # Download the binary
  curl -sLO https://github.com/onepanelio/core/releases/download/latest/opctl-macos-amd64

  # Make binary executable
  chmod +x opctl-macos-amd64

  # Move binary to path
  mv ./opctl-macos-amd64 /usr/local/bin/opctl

  # Test installation
  opctl version
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">

  :::info
  Download the [attached executable](https://github.com/onepanelio/core/releases/latest/download/opctl-windows-amd64.exe), rename it to `opctl` and move it to a folder that is in your PATH environment variable.
  :::

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

2. Run the following command to initialize a `params.yaml` template for AKS:

  ```bash
  opctl init --provider aks \
      --artifact-repository-provider s3 \
      --gpu-device-plugins nvidia \
      --enable-https \
      --enable-cert-manager \
      --dns-provider <dns-provider>
  ```

  :::note
  The `--enable-https` flag is optional and requires a TLS certificate, but it is highly recommended. You can optionally set the `--enable-cert-manager` and `--dns-provider` flags, so TLS certificates are automatically created and renewed via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). If you do not set this flag and your DNS provider isn't one of the [supported DNS providers](/docs/deployment/configuration/tls#supported-dns-providers), then you have to create a wildcard certificate and manually manage it.
  :::

  :::note
  Valid options for `--gpu-device-plugins` are `nvidia` and `amd` or a comma separated combination of both `nvidia,amd`.
  :::

3. Populate `params.yaml` by following the instructions in the template, and referring to [configuration file sections](/docs/deployment/configuration/files#sections) for more detailed information.

  :::tip
  It is highly recommended that you commit `params.yaml` file into a private repository and encrypt it with [BlackBox](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox) or use a secret management service like [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/), [AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), [GCP Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) or [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).
  :::

4. Finally, run the following command to deploy to your cluster:

  ```bash
  opctl apply
  ```

  :::note
  If the command completes but it indicates that your cluster is not ready, you can check status again by running `opctl app status`. If you're still seeing issues, visit our [Troubleshooting](/docs/deployment/troubleshooting/overview) page.
  :::

5. Once the deployment completes, the CLI will display the IP and wildcard domain you need to use to setup your DNS. You can also get this information again by running:

  ```bash
  opctl app status
  ```

6. Create an `A` record in your DNS provider based on the instructions above.

  :::note
  You should use a wildcard `A` record, for example: `*.example.com` or `*.subdomain.example.com`
  :::

  :::tip
  If you're waiting for your DNS record to propogate, you can set up a [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) to quickly test the deployment.
  :::

7. Wait a few minutes and check the URL mentioned in the instructions above. Your applications should load with a screen prompting you to enter a token.

  :::note
  If the application is not loading, visit our [Troubleshooting](/docs/deployment/troubleshooting/overview) page for some steps that can help resolve most issues. If you are still having issues, join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/onepanel-ce/shared_invite/zt-eyjnwec0-nLaHhjif9Y~gA05KuX6AUg) or open an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/onepanelio/core/issues).
  :::

8. Use the following command to get your auth token to log into Onepanel:

  ```bash
  opctl auth token
  ```
